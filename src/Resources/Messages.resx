Hello!

To get more information about the bot use /help command.

Use the link below to log in using Spotify and generate playlists.

Bot can generate playlists from the other playlists or liked tracks and get Spotify recommendations for them

The idea is based on concept called *presets*: set of *included playlists*, *excluded playlists* and *targeted playlists*:
1. *Targeted playlists* are your destination playlists for generated tracks
2. *Included playlists* are the sources for tracks
3. *Excluded playlists* tracks are removed from both recommended and included tracks

Additionally, *preset* has the next options:
1. Include/exclude/ignore liked tracks - how to utilize liked tracks during the process of generation
2. Enable/disable recommendations - either ask Spotify to get recommendations for tracks or not
3. Playlist size - the amount of tracks to be put into *targeted playlists*

A few use cases:
1. *Don't listen twice*
Track already listened songs by automatically putting them into *targeted playlist* and exclude them from the next generations
2. *Fresh Daily Mixes*
Exclude your liked tracks from Daily Mixes and listen to the fresh mixes
3. *Get recommendations for your liked tracks*
Create preset with included liked tracks and receive recommendations right into *targeted playlist*
4. *Randomize your liked tracks*
Include your liked tracks and put them into *targeted playlist* in random order

*Q:* Why tracks, that I've added to playlist using Spotify, are not respected by the bot?
*A:* Bot uses caching in order not to bomb Spotify API with requests. Your playlist tracks is cached once a week. For the moment there is no possibility to force cache clean.
*Q:* Why sometimes it takes minutes to generate my playlist?
*A:* When cached playlist tracks expires, we need to fetch tracks from Spotify API, which takes some time.
